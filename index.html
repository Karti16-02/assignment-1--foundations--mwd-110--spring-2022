    <p> Project Karti is an upcoming clothing brand. I first came up with the idea to make a clothing brand once I started to see that everyone was wearing the same brands. All designs made for Project Karti, are made personally by yours truly. Project Karti is a way for people to show off their style in their own unique way. I can also ensure that once I begin to drop, I will end up making this brand well known around the world. </p>
